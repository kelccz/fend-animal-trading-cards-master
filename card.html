                    Because cats were venerated in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to have
                    been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the
                    Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago.

                    Cats have either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed
                    cats in a process of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged
                    from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.
